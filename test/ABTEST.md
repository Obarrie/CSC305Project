A/B Test Name: Leaving Parking Lot Notification
* User Story Number: #7
* Metric (from the HEART grid): Engagement
Hypothesis: Many users may not actively use the Easy Parking app when leaving the parking lot, resulting in missed opportunities for engagement. By implementing a leaving parking lot notification feature that prompts users to provide feedback on parking availability or their intent to leave, we aim to increase user engagement and retention.
Experiment:
For the experiment setup, we will allocate 50% of our user base to the experiment group and the remaining 50% to the control group. All users will have access to the leaving parking lot notification feature, but only users in the experiment group will receive notifications. Firebase Analytics will be utilized to track user responses to the leaving parking lot notification, including the percentage of users who interact with the notification and their feedback on parking availability or intent to leave.
Variations:
* Variation A: Leaving parking lot notification with a direct question: "Are you leaving the parking lot?"
* Variation B: Leaving parking lot notification with an indirect question: "Is the parking lot full?"
Both variations will include options for users to respond with "Yes" or "No" and will provide an opportunity for users to provide additional feedback if desired. Diagrams and mockups illustrating the notification interface for both variations will be included in the experiment setup for visual reference.
