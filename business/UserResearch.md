# Observation 1:

**Observation Statement:**
Many students who live on campus would live off campus if parking was easier.

**Supporting Data:**
Out of 117 respondents who live on campus, 86 (73.5%) answered that they would
live off campus and commute by car if it was easier.

**Team Action:**
Since ease/speed is important to students, our marketing/awareness campaigns 
should lean into how our app makes parking easier/faster in order to convince
them to use our app.

**Team Action:**
We are working on creating an application that would help students find parking quickly and efficiently by determining the traffic of the parking lot and the available parking lots students could park in. 

# Observation 3:
