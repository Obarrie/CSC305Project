# Observation 1:

**Observation Statement:**
Many students who live on campus would live off campus if parking was easier.

**Supporting Data:**
Out of 117 respondents who live on campus, 86 (73.5%) answered that they would
live off campus and commute by car if it was easier.

**Team Action:**
Since ease/speed is important to students, our marketing/awareness campaigns 
should lean into how our app makes parking easier/faster in order to convince
them to use our app.
